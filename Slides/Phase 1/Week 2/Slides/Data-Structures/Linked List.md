# Linked List

* You are provided with the basic code for a Linked List with \_\_init\_\_, \_\_len\_\_, \_\_eq\_\_, and insert already implemented. Your goal is to implement the methods listed below in the specified runtime. Tests are provided for each implementation 
* Implement delete, search and traverse all in O(n) runtime
* Implement add_to_end in O(1) runtime. This method simply adds an element to the end of the list
  * Hint: Need to modify \_\_init\_\_ and possibly other methods as well


```Python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, first, next = None):
    self.first = first
    self.next = next
  def __len__(self):
    if self.next == None:
      return 1
    else:
      return 1 + len(self.nextor
   def __eq__(self, other):
    while self != None or other != None:
      if self.first != other.first:
        return False
      self = self.next
      other = other.next
    return True if self == None and other == None else False
      
  def insert(self, index, num):
    if index == 0:
      new_node = Node(num)
      new_node.next = self
      self = new_node
    elif index == 1:
      new_node = Node(num)
      new_node.next = self.next
      self.next = new_node
    else:
      self.next.insert(index - 1, num)
      
  def delete(self, num):
    pass
  def search(self, num):
    pass
  def traverse(self):
    pass
```

* Initialization
```Python
lst = Node(1, Node(9, Node(2, Node(10, Node(5, None)))))
```

* Deletion
```Python
lst.delete(2)
lst == Node(1, Node(9, Node(10, Node(5, None))))

lst.delete(20) == lst
```

* Search - return the index where element is found, or -1 if it doesn't exist(Assuming delete did not happen)
```Python
lst.search(1) == 0
lst.search(9) == 1
lst.search(100) == -1
```

* Traverse (Assuming delete did not happen)
```Python
lst.traverse() == '[1, 9, 2, 10, 5]' # This function outputs a list in string format
```

* Add_to_end (Assuming delete did not happen)
```Python
lst.add_to_end(20) == Node(1, Node(9, Node(2, Node(10, Node(5, Node(20, None)))))
```
